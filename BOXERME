For testing on webots, please run:

make setup_webots_boxer

Then proceed to Player/Lib and run:

lua run_prime.lua

This will track your skeleton

The open Webots and open the boxer.wbt world file.

Press 8 to get the robot to walk.

When standing in front of the Kinect, tilting back and forth affects the walking pitch.
Twisting left and right affects the yaw, and rocking left and right affects the roll (the roll is the toughest to see an impact).


MATLAB Debugging
================
While run_prime is still going, in MATLAB, execute:

Skeleton

Toggle 'r' to see the sate of the rotation.
Toggle 'l' to log your movements.

Kill Skeleton with Ctrl+C

To replay your logs, load the skel_XXX.mat file into the workspace (you will see the LOG variable)
Then run:

Skeleton('l')

which has the same 'r' functionality.

Replay the logs for webots
==========================
The skel_XXX.lua file works with run_prime.lua

Kill run_prime.lua, then run:

lua run_prime.lua skel_XXX.lua

This replays the logs so that webots can react to them.

TODO
====
Concatenate log files, or loop the logfile over and over.
