For testing on webots, please run:
=====================

make setup_webots_boxer

Then proceed to Player/Lib and run:

sudo lua run_prime.lua

This will track your skeleton

Then sudo open Webots and open the boxer.wbt world file.

Press 8 to get the robot to walk.

When standing in front of the Kinect, tilting back and forth affects the walking pitch.
Twisting left and right affects the yaw, and rocking left and right affects the roll (the roll is the toughest to see an impact).


MATLAB Debugging
================
While run_prime is still going, in sudo MATLAB, execute:

Skeleton

Toggle 'r' to see the sate of the rotation.
Toggle 'l' to log your movements.
Toggle '3' to see the coordinates in 3D

Kill Skeleton with Ctrl+C

To replay your logs, load the skel_XXX.mat file into the workspace (you will see the LOG variable)
Then run:

Skeleton('l')

which has the same 'r' functionality.

Replay the logs for webots
==========================
The skel_XXX.lua file works with run_prime.lua

Kill run_prime.lua, then run:

lua run_prime.lua skel_XXX.lua

This replays the logs so that webots can react to them.

Running over the network
========================
run make clean
run make setup_boxer

cp Test/loadpaths.lua Player/Lib
edit the run_prime.lua file and set net=true
edit World/TeamPrimeQ.lua to select wired of wireless transmission

lua run_prime.lua

On the robot
============
run make setup_op

edit World/TeamPrimeQ.lua to select wired of wireless transmission
ENSURE ROBOT ID IS 2 or more
lua run_dcm.lua

lua test_box.lua
Press 'z' to toggle stabilization
