This is a text file of installation and setup notes for the sim pc's:
"jeangray" and "storm"

* 240Gb SSD reserved for programs and OS
  Install Windows to 80Gb primary partition
  Install Ubuntu to the rest, no swap
  Advanced note: format with GPT label and ntfs filesystem type

* 500Gb disc drive
  250Gb goes to /home for linux users
  250Gb goes to /scratch for temp. file storage

* RAID drive
  Main file storage, someone should set up as a networked drive

Setup instructions:
1) Install Windows 7 on a 80Gb primary partition on the 240Gb SSD.  Use the
windows install to partition the drive to an 80Gb piece, and a second
(unformatted) piece.
 * If your keyboard and mouse don't work while booting from the windows
 install disc, get an older one.  The Logitecs we purchased with the Xi
 PC's didn't seem to work.
 * If the comp does not boot off the CD automatically, the magic key is
 "f8" and you need to press it when you see the diagnostic info at boot
 * I didn't bother to limit the Windows 7 install at the time, I just
 completely wiped the SSD and installed Windows there.  Under the Ubuntu
 install procedure, I'll resize the Win partion to 80Gb
2) Install Microsoft Security Essentials from the web, and let it complete
it's initial setup and scan.
3) Install the drivers and utilities (separate tab) on the ASUS disc
(unfortunately, this takes like 50 restarts).  This makes the keyboard and
mouse work, as well as some other necessary hardware stuff.  Do not install
Norton, Google toolbar, or ASUS WebSpace.  Then go to nvidia's website and
get the latest drivers for the video card.  If you install Java, there's an
autodetect that worked for me, but the video card is the GeForce GTX 680
series.
4) Put in the Ubuntu CD and select the option to manually partition the
disk(s)
3) Select the remaining ~160Gb on the SSD (should be /sda) for the Ubuntu
install.  Do not setup any swap, we decided we don't want it.  Format as
ext4 and select "/" for mounting
4) On the 500Gb disc drive, partition the first 250Gb into a primary drive
and select "/home" for mounting.  (The remaining 250Gb will become /scratch
later)
5) Complete the Ubuntu install
6) Reboot.  If it auto-boots to Windows, look below for steps below to
reinstall grub as primary bootloader

Reinstalling grub as primary bootloader:
If you install Windows after installing Ubuntu (or other linux) then
Windows bootloader (called NTLDR?) overwrites grub and makes system boot
only into Windows.  The way to fix this is:
  1) Use a Ubuntu live cd to boot into Ubuntu (from the cd)
  2) Mount the linux drive, terminal command: "sudo mount /dev/sdX# /mnt"
  where X# is replaced by the correct letter-number (sdX# = sda3 if you
  followed instructions above, "fdisk -l" or "parted -l" can give clues to
  which sdX# is correct
  3) Install grub, term command: "sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/
  /dev/sdX" where X is the same letter as before (hopefully sdX=sda)

* Install all updates (update-manager)
* Set up a root password, similar to admin pw with "su" relationship at end
* Installed (sudo apt-get install) software: emacs vim openssh-* subversion
* Installed matlab R2011b (/usr/local/MATLAB/R2011b)

Setup first half of 500Gb disc drive as /home:
Follow tutorial: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving
  1) Setup the partition
  2) Backup and edit fstab to mount partition to /media/home (and reboot)
  3) Use rsync to copy all data from /home to /media/home
  4) Edit fstab to mount as /home (not /media/home) (do not reboot)
  5) Move /home into /old_home and create a new empty /home dir
  6) Reboot, all should be well, delete /old_home

Setup second half of 500Gb disc drive as /scratch:
  1) Use gparted to format 2nd half of 500Gb drive to ext4 (hopefully sdb2)
  2) sudo mkdir /scratch
  3) sudo chmod 777 /scratch
  4) sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /scratch (if not sdb2, find id from gparted)
  5) edit /etc/fstab with "/dev/sdb2 /scratch ext4 defaults 0 3"

Setup dual monitors: "sudo nvidia-settings" and use GUI
