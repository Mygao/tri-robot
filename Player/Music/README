List of tracks that the Naos will play after scoring and leading by
a certain margin, or when we tie up a game.

If you would like to add a song, scp it onto the robot and rename it with the
next number in order from the bottom. Add it to this README, and then modify
the random number generator in bodyReady.lua accordingly to select it.
