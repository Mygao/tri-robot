This is the ASH codebase. It contains software for running experiments on the ASH platform and actuator teststand.

If you have Ubuntu, you can install the necessary dependencies using:

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev luajit swig libboost1.46-dev mesa-common-dev openssh-server gnuplot libpopt-dev libncurses5-dev

You may need to create a symlink to the luajit binary:

$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/luajit* /usr/bin/luajit

To build the codebase, run 'make' with one of the following options:

$ make ash        - for operating the physical ASH robot
$ make teststand  - for operating the linear actuator teststand
$ make webots_ash - for running ASH simulations in webots
$ make tools      - for run-time monitoring using Matlab

To run simulations, you will need to download webots from http://www.cyberbotics.com/download and obtain a pro license. It is recommended to install webots in '/usr/local/webots'.
