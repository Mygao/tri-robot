[] Make use of ultrasound data to decide between ball approach styles
      -> Use ultrasound to get a feel for what the field ahead looks like
[] Variable parameters for different positions on the field/behaviors
      -> Faster tStep
      -> Actually possible now!
[] Strategies for robots through coaching interface?
      -Simple: Have two attackers, two defenders.
      -Just override role switching code
[] Make use of weak gains on the arms and joint encoder readings to tell
   if the robot is near another robot; work this into the approach/position
      -> Will this be useful considering new approach style?
[] Stop resetting of position after goal is scored
      -> Make sure the button reset does not override button presses
         for manual placement
[] Fix the tendency of goalie to fall over 
[?] Tendecy of kick to fall over
[] Head sweep needs to wait a second after first seeing goal
      -> Also needs to be as fast as possible
[] Always align for any kick (make sure we do not kick out of bounds)
      -> Especially when approaching the opposing goal
[] Load new OS on one robot, show dickens as we do
[] Use touchdown sensors to decide whether or not manual placement has occured to reset particles.
[] When you move from penalty to set, reset particles for manual placement



[x] Variable parameters for orbit
[x] Make head sweep up after walk kick
[x] Make walk kick continue walking forward after kick
      -> Should be some code in bodyPosition which causes robot to set 
         home position to where ball used to be
[x] Finish reverting localization and Vision until these things work
   adequately
[x] Always do walk kick at kick off
[x] Look for false ball detection; take logs as robot moves
      -> Try turning top of shared memory off? (Jordan)
[x] If the robot falls, it should take an attacker 'penalty'
      -> Is this already included
[x] Odometry monitor (try removing World.update_vision in Cognition.lua ?)
[x] Separate out kicking logic functionality from bodyAppraoch into module
      -> Require in bodyPosition as well, do not orbit for walk kick
[x] Stabilize parameter switching to the point where it becomes usable
[x] Check ultrasound as the robots move
[x] Letter to technical committee (We CANNOT use the chest button to reset localization)
[x] Fix role-indicator LEDs
[x] Dickens: Test lines/corners
