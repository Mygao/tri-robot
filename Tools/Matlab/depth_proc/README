= (mostly working on using kinect depth)
= setting user defined mode (uisetting.m) 
= use models for different types of plane  

Update: 2015. Feb. 19 
= added unpack code (main_unpacklogdata.m)
= use bwlabeln instead of my code to compute connectivity (only for Matlab use)
= set starting points from the previous cluster means (Mean Shift)
