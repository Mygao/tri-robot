This folder contains code for the field computer to find the planes in each RGBD frame or each Mesh frame.

Lidar-based plane detection 

1) Using streaming data 
   ******************************
   run main_stream_all.m (This is matlab code)
 
   ******************************
   * If you don't want plots, 
   set the second input argument of detectPlaneInstances_lidar function to 0. 
   (in the 69th line). 
   example >> detectPlaneInstances_lidar_v5( ~ , 0, ~); 

   ****************************************
   * Output of detectPlaneInstances_lidar
    is a cell containing N number of planes detected. 
    Each element is a struct with fields Center, Normal, Points, and Size.
    'Points' is a set of border points, which is currently sampled as the bounding box by 8-directional search.
    'Size' is the number of points that belong to the plane. 

    For example, you will see somthing like this: 
    >> Planes
    Planes = 
    [1x1 struct]    [1x1 struct]    [1x1 struct]    [1x1 struct]
    >> Planes{1}
    ans = 
    Center: [3x1 single]
    Normal: [3x1 single]
    Points: [3x12 double]
      Size: 936
    
    
2) Using log data 
   open main_planeEstLinar_v3.m 
   set foldername and datestamp 
   and run it.
